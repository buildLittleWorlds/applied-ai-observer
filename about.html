      <h2>About This Newsletter</h2>

      <p>The Applied AI Observer tracks important developments in artificial intelligence and its practical applications. This newsletter serves as an example for students in CAH 205 at Lindenwood University, demonstrating the kind of engaged, analytical writing the course encourages.</p>

      <p>Each post covers a significant AI story—new tools, policy developments, research breakthroughs, or cultural shifts—and offers analysis rather than just summary. The goal is to model how to think critically about AI news and its implications.</p>

      <h3>Part of the Applied AI News Network</h3>

      <p>This blog participates in the Applied AI Dashboard, an aggregator that collects posts from student newsletters across the course. Together, these blogs create a distributed network of perspectives on AI in everyday life and work.</p>
