## What Is This?

The Applied AI Observer is a simple online newsletter—a website where posts about AI news and analysis get published regularly. It covers stories like new AI tools, how people are using AI in their work, and what these developments might mean for the future.

This newsletter serves as the instructor example for CAH 205: Fundamentals of Applied AI at Lindenwood University. Students in the course create their own newsletters following the same format.

## How Does It Work?

This is a "static website"—which just means it's a collection of files (HTML and CSS) that display in your web browser. There's no database, no login system, no complicated software running behind the scenes.

Here's the basic setup:

- **index.html** — The homepage that lists all the posts
- **style.css** — The file that controls how everything looks (colors, fonts, spacing)
- **Individual post files** — Each post is its own HTML file (like `claude-code-goes-viral.html`)
- **about.html** — A page explaining what the newsletter is about

When someone visits the website, their browser downloads these files and displays them. That's it.

## Where Does It Live?

The website is hosted for free using **GitHub Pages**, a service that turns a collection of files into a live website. The files are stored in this GitHub repository, and GitHub automatically publishes them at the URL above.

## Part of a Larger Network

This newsletter feeds into the [Applied AI Dashboard](https://buildlittleworlds.github.io/cah205-spring2026-dashboard/), which aggregates posts from all the student newsletters in the course. The dashboard automatically checks each newsletter for new posts and displays them in one place.
