      <h2>Journalists Learn to Vibe Code: Hard Fork's Show and Tell</h2>
      <p class="meta">January 11, 2026</p>

      <p>The Claude Code viral moment isn't just about engineers anymore. On this week's episode of Hard Fork, the New York Times tech podcast, hosts Kevin Roose and Casey Newton devoted a segment to showing off what they built over the holiday break using Claude Code. Neither is a professional programmer. Both came away impressed—and a little unsettled.</p>

      <p>This matters because when tech journalists start building functional apps in hours instead of just writing about them, we're watching the "vibe coding" phenomenon spread beyond Silicon Valley into the mainstream.</p>

      <h3>What They Built</h3>

      <p>Casey Newton, who writes the Platformer newsletter, built a complete personal website in about an hour. Not a template. A custom site with animated loading screens, live feeds pulling his recent articles and podcast episodes, a working email subscription box, and his Bluesky posts. He canceled his $200-a-year Squarespace subscription and now hosts it for free.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>"We are now back, Kevin, to the beautiful beginning where it is just fun to make websites again. You can do whatever you want on the web. And all you have to do is type what you want into a box. Are you kidding me? I am so happy about this."</p>
        <cite>— Casey Newton, Hard Fork (January 9, 2026)</cite>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Kevin Roose rebuilt his own website in 20 minutes, complete with an Easter egg that turns the page into a 1990s Geocities nightmare on command. But his more ambitious project was a full clone of Pocket, the read-it-later app that Mozilla discontinued. His version—which he built in about two hours—has a Chrome extension, a mobile app, Kindle highlights sync, and text-to-speech for articles. Just this morning, he said on the show, he asked Claude to add the text-to-speech feature, and five minutes later it was working.</p>

      <h3>The Non-Coder Perspective</h3>

      <p>What makes this segment striking is how explicitly Newton and Roose position themselves as outsiders to programming. Newton describes himself as "not a technical person" who spent decades struggling with website building. Roose admits he doesn't know how to build things. Yet both produced functional, polished-looking software.</p>

      <p>Newton compared the feeling to being Neo in The Matrix—suddenly upgraded, suddenly capable of things that were impossible before. But he noted that his boyfriend, who works at Anthropic, offered a different perspective: imagine how it feels if you're a software engineer watching this happen. The technology that gives one person superpowers may feel threatening to another.</p>

      <h3>Why This Matters</h3>

      <p>When we covered the Google engineer's viral tweet about Claude Code, we noted that the shift happening in software development will likely spread to other fields. Hard Fork's vibe coding segment is evidence of that spread in real time. Two journalists with no coding background are now building tools they actually use—not demos, not experiments, but software they've integrated into their daily workflows.</p>

      <p>The barriers are falling fast. Newton explicitly tied this to the future of the web itself: if people can make websites for fun again, maybe that's part of how we rescue the internet from becoming nothing but AI slop and corporate platforms. Or maybe these same tools will make deception and manipulation easier than ever. On the same episode, Newton described catching someone using AI to fabricate documents for a fake corporate whistleblower story—a reminder that these capabilities cut both ways.</p>

      <h3>What to Watch</h3>

      <p>Pay attention to who starts building. If journalists can do this, so can teachers, researchers, small business owners, artists, and students. The question is no longer whether AI will change knowledge work but how quickly the change will spread and who will be empowered—or displaced—as it does.</p>
